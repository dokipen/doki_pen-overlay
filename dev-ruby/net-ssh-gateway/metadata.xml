Net::SSH::Gateway is a library for programmatically tunneling connections to servers via a single "gateway" host. It is useful for establishing Net::SSH connections to servers behind firewalls, but can also be used to forward ports and establish connections of other types, like HTTP, to servers with restricted access.
